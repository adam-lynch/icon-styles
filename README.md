icon-styles-generator
===========

A tool that parses a directory for images, combines them (or base64 encodes them) and generates your CSS, LESS, SASS or Stylus code for the sprites (or data-URIs).

It'll be available via command-line with options & flags and via an API.

### Todo:
Too early to be usable yet. See [issues](https://github.com/adam-lynch/icon-styles/issues) for what I've planned.
