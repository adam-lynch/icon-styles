icon-styles-generator
===========

A tool that parses a directory for images, combines them (or base64 encodes them) and generates your CSS, LESS, SASS or Stylus code for the sprites (or data-URIs).

Too early to be usable yet. TODO;

* OOP
* Test (via PHPUnit and maybe Mockery)
* Build (via BuildHive)
* SASS
* Stylus
* CSS
* accept a max-width param
* data-URI
* output a second set of grayscale sprites based on param switch
